    <p>Grilled leeks are simple to prepare, and their mildly sweet flavor complements just about anything else you can put on the grill.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large leeks, root ends and dark green tops removed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Cut each leek into 4-inch sticks, then cut each stick in half lengthwise.</li>
      <li>Place leek sticks in a bowl. Pour olive oil on top. Season with salt and pepper. Gently toss to combine.</li>
      <li>Place leek sticks directly on the grill grate, cut side down. Cook until grill marks form, about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Using tongs, gently flip leeks over. Cook until grill marks form and leeks are beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Splash lemon juice over the tops. Cook 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>
